# Hello  visitors
## Who am I?
My name is Ammar, and this GitHub account you have stumbled upon is my private account I use for fun projects and university duties. I am a Software Engineer with a passion for visually pleasing and interactive experiences and this account is the place where I will track my progress. There may not be much here now, but all good things take time :D
